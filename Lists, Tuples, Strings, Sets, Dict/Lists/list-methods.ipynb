    "Prompt : What are different list methods in Python ?\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, lists are a versatile data structure that can hold an ordered collection of items. Lists come with a variety of built-in methods that allow you to manipulate, modify, and work with the data stored within them. Here are some of the commonly used list methods in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `append(item)`: Adds an item to the end of the list.\n",
    "2. `extend(iterable)`: Adds all items from an iterable (e.g., another list, tuple, or string) to the end of the list.\n",
    "3. `insert(index, item)`: Inserts an item at a specified index within the list.\n",
    "4. `remove(item)`: Removes the first occurrence of a specific item from the list.\n",
    "5. `pop(index=-1)`: Removes and returns the item at the specified index. If no index is provided, the last item is removed.\n",
    "6. `index(item, start=0, end=len(list))`: Returns the index of the first occurrence of the specified item within the specified range.\n",
    "7. `count(item)`: Returns the number of occurrences of a specific item in the list.\n",
    "8. `sort(key=None, reverse=False)`: Sorts the items in the list in ascending order. The `key` parameter can be used to provide a custom sorting function, and `reverse` can be set to `True` to sort in descending order.\n",
    "9. `reverse()`: Reverses the order of the items in the list.\n",
    "10. `copy()`: Returns a shallow copy of the list.\n",
    "11. `clear()`: Removes all items from the list, making it empty.\n",
    "12. `len(list)`: Returns the number of items in the list.\n",
    "13. `list(iterable)`: Converts an iterable (e.g., a tuple, string, or another list) into a new list.\n",
    "14. `max(list)`: Returns the maximum item in the list.\n",
    "15. `min(list)`: Returns the minimum item in the list.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example usage:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "my_list = [3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9, 2, 6, 5, 3]\n",
    "\n",
    "my_list.append(8)\n",
    "my_list.extend([7, 0])\n",
    "my_list.insert(2, 2.5)\n",
    "my_list.remove(5)\n",
    "popped_item = my_list.pop(4)\n",
    "index_of_3 = my_list.index(3)\n",
    "count_of_1 = my_list.count(1)\n",
    "my_list.sort()\n",
    "my_list.reverse()\n",
    "\n",
    "print(my_list)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember that these are just a subset of the methods available for working with lists in Python. Each method serves a specific purpose, allowing you to manipulate and manage your data effectively."

    "\n",
    "Both the `remove()` and `pop()` methods are used to remove elements from a list in Python, but they work in slightly different ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `remove(item)`: The `remove()` method is used to remove the first occurrence of a specified item from the list. It does not require an index as an argument; instead, you provide the actual value of the item you want to remove. If the item is not found in the list, a `ValueError` is raised.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   my_list = [3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9]\n",
    "   my_list.remove(1)  # Removes the first occurrence of 1\n",
    "   print(my_list)  # Output: [3, 4, 1, 5, 9]\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. `pop(index=-1)`: The `pop()` method is used to remove and return an item at a specified index from the list. If an index is not provided, it defaults to -1, which means the last item is removed. The `pop()` method returns the removed item, allowing you to store it in a variable if needed. If the index is out of range, an `IndexError` is raised.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   my_list = [3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9]\n",
    "   popped_item = my_list.pop(2)  # Removes and returns the item at index 2 (4)\n",
    "   print(my_list)  # Output: [3, 1, 1, 5, 9]\n",
    "   print(popped_item)  # Output: 4\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary:\n",
    "- Use `remove(item)` when you want to remove a specific value from the list, and you don't necessarily care about the index.\n",
    "- Use `pop(index)` when you want to remove an item at a specific index and potentially use the removed item.\n",
    "\n",
    "Keep in mind that both methods modify the original list. If you're unsure about the existence of an item or the index, you might want to use appropriate error handling mechanisms (like `try` and `except`) to handle potential exceptions.\n",
