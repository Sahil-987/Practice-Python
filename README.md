# Python Practice Repository

Welcome to the Python Practice repository! This repository is a collection of various Python programming exercises and projects that I've been working on to enhance my coding skills and deepen my understanding of Python concepts. The contents of this repository are meant to showcase my daily progress and growth as a Python developer.


## About

This repository serves as a learning playground where I experiment with different Python topics and concepts. It contains exercises, projects, and examples related to different areas of Python programming, including data structures, algorithms, object-oriented programming, file handling, decorators, and more.

My goal is to continuously expand this repository with new challenges, solutions, and insights gained through my Python coding journey.

## Project Structure

The project is structured as follows:

- `decorators`: Directory containing examples and exercises related to Python decorators.
- `DSA-Python`: Directory for data structures and algorithms in Python.
- `fibonacci`: Directory with examples of generating Fibonacci sequences.
- `file-handling`: Directory containing exercises on Python file handling.
- Other individual Python files: Individual scripts and notebooks on various topics.
- `OOPs`: Directory with examples of object-oriented programming concepts.
- `pattern`: Directory with pattern printing examples.
- `README.md`: You are reading it right now!
- `rough.ipynb`: A notebook for rough code snippets and experiments.

## Contents

This repository covers a wide range of Python concepts, including:

- Basics of Python programming.
- Object-oriented programming (OOP) principles and practice.
- Working with data structures and algorithms.
- Handling files and input/output operations.
- Using decorators to modify functions' behavior.
- Exploring patterns and sequences.
- Miscellaneous topics to showcase my coding progress.

## Usage

Feel free to explore the contents of this repository to learn about different aspects of Python programming. You can review the code, run the scripts, and experiment with the examples to deepen your own understanding.
